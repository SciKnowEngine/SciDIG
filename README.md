# Scientific Knowledge Graphs (SciKnowGraph)

The underlying idea of this project is to develop linked data ontologies for given scientific domains and map data from sources into those representations based on ISI's 'Domain Insight Graph' (DIG) toolset as a development environment for our technology and our approach (http://dig.isi.edu). 

The semantic model for this work is driven by the concstruct shown in Figure 1.

Our approach Our first area of exploration are Neuroscience Domain Insight Graphs (neuDIGs) to serve the needs if systems-level neuroscience: an advanced, complex scientific subject. We intend this work to provide a large-scale, practical, common representation for neuroscientific knowledge that are primarily concerned with properties and characteristics of **neuron populations** that may (or may not) be explicitly identified by name. 

This repository houses the neuDIGs ontology, linked data sets that conform to it, tooling, documentation and reasoning/modeling/inference systems. It is an interpretive model (see [Burns & Chalupsky (2014) "It's all Made Up" AAAI Workshop on Discovery Informatics](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW14/paper/view/8735)) and is intended to be lightweight, practical representation linked data for neuroscience.
